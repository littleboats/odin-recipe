    Basic Marinara</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple recipe for marinara sauce.  It can be used as a base for other varieties of red sauce with a little modification to your taste.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 whole yellow or white onion, diced</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 whole larhe carrots, peeled and finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cans (28 ounces each) whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp. sugar (or to taste)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. minced fresh oregano (or dried, if that is what you have)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. minced fresh parsley, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>cooked pasta, for serving</li>
        <li>fresh parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic, and carrots and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour the tomatoes and juice in a large bowl and use your hands to gently squish/smush the tomatoes so that the juices are released and they are all broken up.  Add the contents of the bowl to the pot and stir.</li>
        <li>Add the salt, pepper, sugar, and oregano (or other dried or fresh herbs).  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for <strong>1 1/2 hours</strong>, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add minced fresh parsley at the end and  taste/adjust the sauce for seasonings.</li>
        <li>Toss with pasta, then serve on top of the pasta with parmesan and more parsley (or fresh basil if you have it).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: If you like a slightly deeper flavor, add the optional tomato paste when you add the tomatoes.)</p>
